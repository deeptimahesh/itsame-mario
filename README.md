# itsame-mario

1) MAKE A BOARD WHICH MOVES : LARGE 2D array? using numpy  (DONE)
2) Gravity effect (DONE)
3) Generate enemies (WED)
4) Design a board: score = coins on top of obstacles
5) Obstacles randomly generated   (DONE)
6) 


BUGS
>> Up: make it so while(x_coords != width -3)  --> config_down :::: DONE
>> UP: make it go one more up AND go down until brick/ground/pipe/question OR not!empty 


##HARD CODE TWO BOARDS : TWO LEVELS

i. Hardcode obstacles first: for normal sized board, 
then large size which moves when character reaches say middle of board

ii. Hardcode steps, stairs, bricks in another file, print it out

iii. Pipe at end of level

iv. make it short, it's cool


##DEALING WITH MARIO
i. Colliding when falling down with ground/brick should be easy: interrupt config.DOWN so he stays 
wherever he is. If no brick or ground encountered -> keep falling

ii. Reaches end of board <- deal with that

iii. Flag at end? Let's push that to Thursday

iv.  That's it? Wow



On Thursday: Colors (DONE) + sound
